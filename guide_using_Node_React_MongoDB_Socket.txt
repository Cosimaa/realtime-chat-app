- "Producing code" is code that can take some time
- "Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result

* React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.
* The export default keywords specify the main component in the file.
* JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like <br />. Your component also canâ€™t return multiple JSX tags. 
You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a <div>...</div> or an empty <>...</> wrapper.
* You can only call Hooks at the top of your components (or other Hooks).
If you want to use useState in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.
